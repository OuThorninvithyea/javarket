# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the Javarket application.

## Logo Image

To add a custom logo to your login screen:

1. Place your logo image file in this directory
2. Name it `logo.png` (recommended size: 120x120 pixels or larger)
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF

## Current Setup

The login screen will automatically:

- Load `logo.png` if it exists in this directory
- Display it as a 120x120 pixel image above the login form
- Fall back to a text-based logo "ðŸ›’ JAVARKET" if no image is found

## Example Logo

You can use any image editing software to create a logo, or find free logo templates online. Make sure the logo represents your e-commerce brand well!
